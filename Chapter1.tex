\chapter{Astroparticle detection}
% -----------------------------------------------
More than 100 years have passed since Victor Franz Hess first encontered cosmic radiation. Since those times the techniques and methods of detection have been strongly improved. We have moved up from elevating electroscopes by ballons to observe growing electric charge to specialized techniques, which allows us to measure particles' energies, trajectories, etc.

\section{Cosmic rays and particles}
% -----------------------------------------------
Cosmic rays is a term for radiation and energetic particles striking earth atmosphere with an origin in a space sources. We divide them into two major groups - primary and secondary. Primary cosmic rays are the original cosmic particles, which strike the Earth's athmosphere. Secondary cosmic rays (also refered as showers) are particles, which have origin in particle interaction between primary cosmic rays and athmosphere.
\par
Primary cosmic rays consist of protons ($95 \%$), helium nuclei ($4 \%$), electrons and other heavy nuclei (up to iron). However, only the energetic rays make their way to the athmosphere. The Earth's magnetic field affects their trajectories and prevents the low-energetic (less than 100 MeV) particles from arriving to the athmosphere.
\par
Part of primary cosmic rays are also Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), which we refer in the next chapter.
\par
Secondary cosmic rays are created by interaction of high-energetic particles of primary component with air's nucleis, such as nitrogen. They consist of low-energetic and high-energetic muons, gamma photons, electrons and positrons. Most of muons travel up to the earth's surface although their half-life is only about 2.2 microseconds before they decay into electrons. Due to their high relativistic speeds, their half-life is increased for external observers. 

\par 
Neutrinos are also a part of cosmic radiation, but their interaction with matter is very rare, so they are very hard to detect. The special underwater detectors are developed to detect some of them.
