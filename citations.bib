abstract = {The Fluorescence detector Array of Single-pixel Telescopes (FAST) is a design concept for a next-generation UHECR observatory, addressing the requirements for a large-area, low-cost detector suitable for measuring the properties of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), having energies exceeding 30 EeV, with an unprecedented aperture. We have developed a full-scale prototype consisting of four 200 mm diameter photo-multiplier tubes at the focus of a segmented mirror of 1.6 m in diameter. In October 2016, September 2017, and September 2018 we installed three such prototypes at the Black Rock Mesa site of the Telescope Array experiment in central Utah, USA. All three telescopes have been steadily taking data since installation. We report on the design and installation of these prototypes, and present some preliminary results, including measurements of artificial light sources, distant ultraviolet lasers, and UHECRs.}

abstract = {Nowadays, the need for extended uniform light sources increases in many different areas of optics. Integrating spheres show one of the best properties among them. The paper is focused on verification of the practical use of so-called general purpose integrating spheres for the purpose of the calibration of highly sensitive detectors in the near-UV spectrum. To achieve this, the summarization of the theory of the integrating spheres is given, the methodology of the measurement is described and a universal experimental setup is designed. The setup is able to measure the real spatial and angular radiance uniformity of the exit port of selected representative of integrating spheres. The results of radiance uniformity measurements are graphically presented and discussed.}
